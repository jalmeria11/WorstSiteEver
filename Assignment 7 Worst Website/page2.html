    This is the Attack on Titan Season 4 Cover, which is by far my favorite out of the 4 seasons. It shows Eren Yeager, who is the protagonist, in Titan mode fighting against an ally turned enemy in Reiner. </p>

  One of my favorite aspects of Season 4 Part 2 is the intro scene along with the song the creators chose. The scene and song go hand in hand in creating, what I think, the best Attack on Titan Intro Scene. </p>

<div class="whitebox">
  Attack On Titan Season 4 Part 3 needs to come out soon! 
</div>

<div id="positionStatic" class="whitebox">
  I always hate endings to shows especially anime/manga but AOT is bound to come to a true end with part 3.</p>
</div>

<div id="relativeTop" class="whitebox">
  Favorite Charatcer =  <em>Eren Yeager</em> or <em>Levi Ackermann</em>.
</div>

<div id="relativeLeft" class="whitebox">
  Spoiler but I hope Eren's plans get ruined. <em> His powers he has right now are OP.</em><em> His character kinda wild. </em>.

  <p>If  I lose it all, slip and fall

I will never look away.

If I lose it all, lose it all, lose it all.

If I lose it all, outside the wall

Live to die another day.

I don’t want anything, I’m just here to…

Beware!

    Rumbling, Rumbling, it’s coming, Rumbling, Rumbling.</p>
